The first half of this course equips students with the fundamental tools required in order to solve simple partial differential equations (PDEs). This includes important aspects of vector calculus (curvilinear coordinates and integral theorems) as well as Fourier series and an understanding of how to classify PDEs and what this classification means physically. The method of characteristics is then introduced in order to solve First order quasi-linear PDEs. The second half of the course focuses on solving second order PDEs (mainly Laplaceâ€'s equation, the heat equation and the wave equation), first analytically by employing separation of variables and then numerically by introducing the topic of finite difference methods.
