Hi, I am a first year Ph.D student in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](https://nla-group.org/) at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester, supervised by Professor [Nicholas J. Higham](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/index.php) and co-supervised by Professor [Francoise Tisseur](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~ftisseur/).

The fundamental goal of my research is to compute [functions of matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_function) in multiprecision arithmetic, which is concerned with algorithms for evaluating matrix functions in arithmetic of precisions beyond the standard single and double. In particular, this includes [the half precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format) that is becoming prevalent on GPUs and arbitrary precision arithmetic.
